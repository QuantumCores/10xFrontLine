# Repository Guidelines

Front Line is a small polyglot project: an Angular mobile/browser client in `src/mbl`, an ASP.NET Core API in `src/api`, and planning artifacts under `context/foundation`. Treat `context/foundation/prd.md` and `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` as the product and stack source of truth.

## Hard Rules

Do not write to `context/archive/`; archived changes are immutable. Open a new change under `context/changes/` instead.

Keep generated build output out of commits. `src/api/bin/`, `src/api/obj/`, and Angular build artifacts are local outputs, not source.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `src/mbl/` contains the Angular 22 app. App code lives in `src/mbl/src/app`, global styles in `src/mbl/src/styles.scss`, and static assets in `src/mbl/public`.
- `src/api/` contains the `frontLineApi` ASP.NET Core `net10.0` project. Controllers live in `src/api/Controllers`; configuration is in `appsettings*.json`.
- `context/foundation/` holds product, shaping, and stack decisions. `context/changes/bootstrap-verification/` records scaffold verification notes.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Run Angular commands from `src/mbl`:

- `npm install` installs the pinned npm dependency set from `package-lock.json`.
- `npm start` starts the Angular development server.
- `npm run build` creates the production Angular build and enforces the configured bundle budgets.
- `npm test` is the declared test command; verify the Angular test target exists before relying on it in CI.

Run API commands from the repo root:

- `dotnet build src/api/frontLineApi.csproj` compiles the API.
- `dotnet run --project src/api/frontLineApi.csproj` starts the local API.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Angular uses TypeScript with strict compiler checks from `src/mbl/tsconfig.json`, SCSS component styles, and the `app` selector prefix from `angular.json`. Keep Angular app files in the existing `app.<kind>.ts/html/scss` style unless introducing a real feature directory.

The API uses nullable-enabled C# with implicit usings. Keep controller classes under `src/api/Controllers` and preserve the current namespace style rooted at `frontLineApi`.

## Testing Guidelines

No committed specs or API test project exist yet. For Angular tests, place `*.spec.ts` files under `src/mbl/src` so `tsconfig.spec.json` includes them. For API tests, add a separate test project rather than mixing tests into `src/api`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Commit messages use short `QC:` commit prefixes, for example `QC: tech stack`. Keep subjects concise and imperative. Pull requests should name the touched area (`src/mbl`, `src/api`, or `context`), link the relevant context document or issue, list commands run, and include screenshots for UI changes.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 2

Turn one roadmap item into the first implementation cycle with the **change planning chain**:

```
/10x-roadmap -> /10x-new -> /10x-plan -> /10x-plan-review -> /10x-implement
```

`/10x-new`, `/10x-plan`, `/10x-plan-review`, and `/10x-implement` are the lesson focus. `/10x-frame` and `/10x-research` are not required rituals here; they are escalation paths introduced in the next lesson.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Change setup (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-new <change-id>` | You selected a roadmap item and need a stable change folder. Creates `context/changes/<change-id>/change.md` so planning, implementation, progress, commits, and later review all share one identity. Use AFTER roadmap selection, BEFORE `/10x-plan`. |
| **Planning (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-plan <change-id>` | You have a change folder and need a reviewable implementation plan. Reads roadmap context, foundation docs, codebase evidence, and any existing change notes; writes `plan.md` and `plan-brief.md` with phases, file contracts, success criteria, and `## Progress`. |
| **Plan readiness (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-plan-review <change-id>` | You have `plan.md` and need a light pre-code readiness check. Use it to catch missing end state, weak contracts, malformed progress, scope drift, or blind spots before code changes begin. |
| **Implementation (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <n>` | You have an approved plan and want to execute one phase with verification, manual gate, commit ritual, and SHA write-back to `## Progress`. |
| **Lifecycle closure** | |
| `/10x-archive <change-id>` | A change is merged or intentionally closed. Move it out of active `context/changes/` into archive state. |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-new` creates the durable change identity.
- `/10x-plan` turns that identity into an implementation contract.
- `/10x-plan-review` checks the plan before the agent mutates code.
- `/10x-implement` executes one planned phase, verifies, asks for manual confirmation when needed, commits, and records progress.

### Lesson boundaries

- Plan is the default router after roadmap selection. Start with `/10x-plan` unless the problem is unclear or external evidence is blocking.
- Do not run `/10x-frame + /10x-research` as ceremony for every change.
- Do not turn this lesson into a full end-to-end product build. A checkpoint with a planned and partially or fully implemented stream is valid.
- Code review of the implemented diff belongs to Lesson 3 via `/10x-impl-review`.
- Lifecycle closure via `/10x-archive` after a change is merged or intentionally closed.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/roadmap.md` - upstream roadmap
- `context/changes/<change-id>/change.md` - change identity
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - implementation contract
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan-brief.md` - compressed handoff
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` - load-bearing names registry

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
